        "text=\"वाराणसी में 72वें राष्ट्रीय वॉलीबॉल टूर्नामेंट के उद्घाटन के दौरान वीडियो कॉन्फ्रेंसिंग के माध्यम से प्रधानमंत्री के संबोधन का मूल पाठ हर हर महादेव। उत्तर प्रदेश के मुख्यमंत्री योगी  आदित्यनाथ जी, उप मुख्यमंत्री ब्रजेश पाठक जी, यूपी सरकार में मंत्री भाई रविंद्र जायसवाल, दयाशंकर जी, गिरीश यादव जी, बनारस के मेयर भाई अशोक तिवारी जी, अन्य जनप्रतिनिधिगण, वॉलीबॉल एसोसिएशन के सभी पदाधिकारी, देश भर से आए सभी खिलाड़ी, काशी के मेरे परिवारजनों, नमस्कार। आज काशी के सांसद के नाते आप सभी खिलाड़ियों का स्वागत और अभिनंदन करते हुए मुझे बहुत खुशी हो रही है। आज से काशी में नेशनल वॉलीबॉल चैंपियनशिप का  शुभारंभ हो रहा है। आप सभी खिलाड़ी बहुत कड़ी मेहनत के बाद इस नेशनल टूर्नामेंट तक पहुंचे हैं। आपने जो मेहनत की है, आने वाले दिनों में काशी के मैदान पर उसकी परीक्षा होगी। वैसे मुझे बताया गया है कि देश के 28 राज्यों की टीमें यहां जुटी हैं। यानी आप सब एक भारत, श्रेष्ठ भारत, की बहुत सुंदर तस्वीर भी प्रस्तुत कर रहे हैं। मैं इस चैंपियनशिप में हिस्सा ले रहे सभी खिलाड़ियों को बहुत-बहुत शुभकामनाएं देता हूं।साथियों,हमारे यहां बनारसी में कहा जाता है, बनारस के जानल चाहत हउव, त बनारस आवे के पड़ि, तो आप लोग बनारस आ गए हैं, और अब बनारस को जान भी जाएंगे। हमारा बनारस खेल प्रेमियों का शहर है। कुश्ती, कुश्ती के अखाड़े, मुक्केबाजी, नौका दौड़, कबड्डी, ऐसे कई खेल यहां बहुत मशहूर हैं। बनारस ने कई खेलों के नेशनल खिलाड़ी भी दिए हैं। बनारस हिंदू यूनिवर्सिटी, यूपी कॉलेज, काशी विद्यापीठ जैसे शिक्षा संस्थानों के खिलाड़ी, राज्य और राष्ट्रीय स्तर पर छाए रहे हैं। और काशी तो हज़ारों वर्षों से उन सबका सत्कार करती आई है, जो ज्ञान और कला की साधना के लिए यहाँ जाते हैं।  और इसलिए मुझे विश्वास है, नेशनल वॉलीबॉल चैंपियनशिप के दौरान बनारस का जोश हाई रहेगा। आप सभी खिलाड़ियों को उत्साह बढ़ाने वाले दर्शक भी मिलेंगे और काशी की आतिथ्य परंपरा को जीने का अवसर भी मिलेगा।साथियों, वॉलीबॉल एक साधारण स्पोर्ट्स नहीं है, नेट के इस पार और उस पार, दोनों तरफ, यह संतुलन का खेल है, यह सहयोग का खेल है, और इस खेल में संकल्पशक्ति भी दिखती है। यानी बॉल को हर कीमत पर ऊपर ही उठाना है। वॉलीबॉल हमें टीम स्पिरिट से जोड़ती है। वॉलीबॉल के हर खिलाड़ी का मंत्र होता है- Team First, हर कोई भले ही अलग-अलग स्किल्स का हो, लेकिन सभी प्लेयर्स अपनी टीम की जीत के लिए खेलते हैं। और मैं तो भारत की डेवलपमेंट स्टोरी और वॉलीबॉल में भी बहुत सी बातें कॉमन देखता हूं। वॉलीबॉल हमें सिखाती है कि  कोई भी जीत, अकेले नहीं होती। हमारी जीत हमारे कोऑर्डिनेशन, हमारे विश्वास और हमारी टीम की तत्परता पर निर्भर होती है। हर किसी की अपनी भूमिका है,अपनी जिम्मेदारी है। और हम तभी सफल होते हैं, जब हर कोई अपनी जिम्मेदारी को बखूबी निभाता है, गंभीरता से निभाता है। हमारा देश भी इसी तरह आगे बढ़ रहा है।  स्वच्छता से डिजिटल पेमेंट तक और एक पेड़ मां के नाम से लेकर विकसित भारत के अभियान तक हम इसलिए प्रगति कर रहे हैं, क्यूंकि देश का हर एक जन, हर एक वर्ग, हर प्रांत एक सामूहिक चेतना से, India First की भावना से, देश के लिए काम कर रहा है।साथियों,आजकल दुनिया में भारत की ग्रोथ की, हमारी इकॉनॉमी की भूरी-भूरी प्रशंसा हो रही है। लेकिन जब देश विकास करता है, तो ये प्रगति सिर्फ आर्थिक मोर्चे तक सीमित नहीं रहती। ये आत्मविश्वास, खेल के मैदान पर भी दिखता है। यही हम बीते कुछ सालों में हर स्पोर्ट्स में देख रहे हैं। साल 2014 के बाद से अलग-अलग खेलों में भारत का प्रदर्शन लगातार बेहतर हुआ है। हमें बहुत गर्व होता है, जब Gen-ज़ी को खेल के मैदान पर तिरंगा फहराते देखते हैं।\""
